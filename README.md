🧠 AI Learning Journey
Welcome to my AI & Machine Learning Portfolio! 🚀
This repository documents my step-by-step journey as I learn and implement key concepts in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science.
I’m starting small — by coding fundamental algorithms from scratch, visualizing them, and then comparing with standard libraries (like Scikit-learn). Over time, I’ll expand this repo with more advanced projects.
📅 Learning Roadmap
✅ Current Stage
 Linear Regression (Closed Form Solution)
 Linear Regression with Gradient Descent
 Comparison with Scikit-learn
🔜 Next Steps
Logistic Regression (classification)
Basic Neural Networks (from scratch)
Real-world datasets & mini-projects
⚙️ Tools & Libraries
Python 3
Jupyter Notebook
Numpy, Matplotlib, Pandas
Scikit-learn
🎯 Goal
My goal is to build a solid foundation in AI by:
Writing algorithms from scratch ✍️
Understanding the math behind them 📐
Visualizing results 📊
Comparing with real libraries 🔧
By the end of this journey, I’ll have a portfolio that shows both practical coding skills and theoretical understanding.
🤝 Follow Along
This is a work in progress. I’ll keep adding notebooks as I learn.
Feel free to ⭐ star the repo or fork it if you want to learn alongside me!
